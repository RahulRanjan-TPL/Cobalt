## Installation Guide

First, have a look on this brief technical [introduction to Cobalt](https://github.com/cobaltians/cobalt/wiki/cobalt-intro) to understand basic principles of the framework.

Then, you are ready to start.

###1) Install Android Studio or XCode

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (mac users only)

This step can take some time. If you already have them on your computer, be sure to have latest XCode version and lastest SDK and JDK for Android Studio.

###2) Install Cobalt

    npm install cobaltians-cli
       
This assume you have [Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Use sudo if needed.

###4) Open the generated iOS or Android project and enjoy !
